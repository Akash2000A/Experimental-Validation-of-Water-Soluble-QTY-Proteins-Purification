# Experimental-Validation-of-Water-Soluble-QTY-Proteins-Purification

Beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMP) are integral components of Gram-negative
bacteria, eukaryotic mitochondria, and chloroplasts. They play essential roles in various
cellular processes, including nutrient transport, membrane stability, host-pathogen
interactions, antibiotic resistance, and more. The advent of AlphaFold2 for accurate protein
structure predictions transformed structural bioinformatic studies. The QTY code
systematically replaces hydrophobic leucine (L), isoleucine (I), valine (V), and phenylalanine
(F) with hydrophilic glutamine (Q), threonine (T), and tyrosine (Y). We here put an effort to
experimentally purify the water-soluble QTY variants of three outer membrane beta-barrel
proteins with known molecular structures, including a) BamA, c) FecA, and c) OmpC. The
superposed structures of OMPs and their QTY variants exhibit remarkable structural
similarity, as evidenced by residue mean square distance (RMSD) values between 0.206Å to
0.414Å despite the replacement of at least 22% (Transmembrane variation) of the amino
acids in the transmembrane regions. Our study provides important insights into the
differences between hydrophobic and hydrophilic beta-barrels and validates the QTY code
experimentally for studying beta-barrel membrane proteins and perhaps other hydrophobic
aggregated proteins.
